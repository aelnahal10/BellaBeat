# Bellabeat Data Analysis Project
## Introduction
This project involves a data analysis case study for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The goal is to analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to one Bellabeat product. The insights derived from this analysis will be used to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Project Overview
The project follows the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. The deliverables for this project include:

1- A clear summary of the business task
2- A description of all data sources used
3- Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4- A summary of the analysis
5- Supporting visualizations and key findings
6- High-level recommendations based on the analysis

## Data Source
The primary data source for this project is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data available on Kaggle. This data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It provides information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.

## Data Processing and Analysis
The data will be processed and analyzed using Python. The processing steps include checking the data for errors, transforming the data for effective analysis, and documenting the cleaning process. The analysis will involve aggregating the data, organizing and formatting the data, performing calculations, and identifying trends and relationships.

## Visualization and Recommendations
The findings from the analysis will be presented through clear and effective data visualizations. The visualizations will highlight the key insights and trends identified in the data. Based on these findings, high-level recommendations will be made for how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Usage
This project is intended for anyone interested in data analysis, particularly in the context of health-focused smart devices. The insights derived from this project could be useful for marketing professionals, product developers, and business strategists in the health tech industry.
