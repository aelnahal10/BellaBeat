# Bellabeat Data Analysis Project
## Introduction
This project involves a data analysis case study for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The goal is to analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to one Bellabeat product. The insights derived from this analysis will be used to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Project Overview
The project follows the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. The deliverables for this project include:

1- A clear summary of the business task

2- A description of all data sources used

3- Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data

4- A summary of the analysis

5- Supporting visualizations and key findings

6- High-level recommendations based on the analysis


## Data Source
The primary data source for this project is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data available on Kaggle. This data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It provides information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.

## Data Processing and Analysis
The data will be processed and analyzed using Python. The processing steps include checking the data for errors, transforming the data for effective analysis, and documenting the cleaning process. The analysis will involve aggregating the data, organizing and formatting the data, performing calculations, and identifying trends and relationships.

## Findings and Conclusion
Sedentary Behavior: Sedentary minutes account for 81.3% of the total. This implies that users are primarily using the FitBit app to log daily activities such as daily commutes, inactive movements (moving from one location to another), or doing errands.

Limited Fitness Tracking: The minor percentages of fairly active activity (1.1%) and extremely active activity (1.7%) suggest that the app is rarely used to track fitness activities like running. This is a significant observation as the FitBit app was designed to promote fitness.

Data Limitations: The datasets used in this analysis have some limitations. Due to a limited number of observations, concrete insights cannot be derived to imply strategies for the products. More data is needed. Also, the datasets do not include other factors like age, gender, or location, which could provide more comprehensive insights.

Unequal Unique IDs: The count of unique IDs from the datasets is unequal, making it difficult to join and identify any correlation between the multiple datasets chosen.

## Conclusion
The majority of FitBit app users (81.3%) use the app to track sedentary behaviors rather than health practices. Users also prefer to track their activities during the week as opposed to the weekends, possibly because they spend more time outside during the week and stay indoors on weekends.

These insights can inform the Bellabeat marketing strategy. The marketing team can encourage customers by educating them about the advantages of fitness, recommending different types of activity, and providing information on calorie intake and burn rate on the Bellabeat app.

## Usage
This project is intended for anyone interested in data analysis, particularly in the context of health-focused smart devices. The insights derived from this project could be useful for marketing professionals, product developers, and business strategists in the health tech industry.
